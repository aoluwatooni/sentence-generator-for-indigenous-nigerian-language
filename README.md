# sentence-generator-for-indigenous-nigerian-language
## Project Brief
This is a Yoruba proverb generator app. The model takes in a keyword or phrase in Yoruba language and generates a proverb in Yoruba language from the given keyword/phrase. Using the keras tokenizer to generate tokens and a Sequential model by adding an embedding layer and a bidirectional LSTM model. We also took into consideration, homonymns and language intonations to help the model generate a more readable proverb. In addition, using the deep-translator library, we added google translator API to help translate the generated Yoruba proverb to English Language for non-yoruba readers.

## Project Objectives
- the aim of this project is to build a ML model that takes in Yoruba word and generate a proverb for that keyword

## Introduction
This is a Yoruba proverb generator app. The model takes in a keyword or phrase in Yoruba language and generates a proverb in Yoruba language from the given keyword/phrase. Using the `keras` tokenizer to generate tokens and a Sequential model by adding an embedding layer and a bidirectional `LSTM model`. We also took into consideration, homonymns and language intonations to help the model generate a more readable proverb. In addition, using the `deep-translator` library, we added google translator API to help translate the generated Yoruba proverb to English Language for non-yoruba readers.

## How To Use The Web App

1. Input Keyword should take in ONLY Yoruba Keywords/phrases with the right intonation marks.
2. Number of Generated words is the number of next keywords you want the model to generate for you.
3. You can only select one of the options under the Number of Generated words which are 5,10,15, or 20.
4. After performing step 1 & 3, click on the Generate Proverbs button.

`NOTE: The english Translation might not give the accurate translation of the generated Yoruba proverb.`
